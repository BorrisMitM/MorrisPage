    summary: 'On My Way started as a student project for the Cologne Game Lab and after the semester finished. Green Erasmus decided to continue development with us. I worked simultaneously on On My Way and Small Steps. The game is about ecological travel and shines light on the different modes of transportation and their impact on the environment. I took this game over from another programmer from my semester and learned how to work with someone else’s code. You can check out the game here.',

    summary: 'Small Steps also started as a student project at the Cologne Game Lab. We also continued developing it after the semester together with Green Erasmus. The game is about Nova who is on their Erasmus exchange year and discovers a weird parallel world in which no environmental awareness exists. They then help their counterpart in the other world to implement some ecological behaviors. You can play it here.',
